<h2>Why to blog in the first place?</h2>
<p>I have been reading blogs since I started the 10th grade mainly for school work which at the time I hated which gave me an impression that no matter the content blogs are boring. 
In the last few months I started reading blogs related to programming and tech (mostly zig content) which nowadays I believe is the best way to learn programming.</p>
<p>So to answer the question, I like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">golden rule</a></p>
<p>That being said I needed to make the blog building fun and that's the reason for this title, so stick with me and I will explain <b>"How to build a blog the hard way".</b></p>

<h2>Template generator vs SSG</h2>
<p><a href="https://git.mzte.de/LordMZTE/confgen">confgen</a> is a tool with the main purpose to generate config files and was my main pick because it is simple to use and I use it a lot for my humble dotfiles but that is a topic for another day.</p>
<p>There are out there many options of ssg and they are all amazing but at the end of the dat they are on most of the cases doing the same as a template generator so why not doing a website with a template generator that I actually use very often</p>
<h2>Confgen</h2>
<p>The perfect tool for those who like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> principle as you can define certain values and use it across multiple files without ever repeating yourself which is why this tool's main purpose is to generate config files (for dotfiles for example). 
For anyone who knows or manages dotfiles it's obvious how useful is this tool but let me give an example. 

<pre><code>
# Example config.ini
background=#101010
color=#F7A41D

# Example config.ini.cgt
background=<&percnt; opt.background &percnt;>
color=<&percnt; opt.color &percnt;>
</code></pre>
